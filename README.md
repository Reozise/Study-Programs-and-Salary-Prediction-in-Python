This project analyzes and models the relationship between academic study programs and graduate salaries in Poland based on 2022 data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and linear regression modeling to predict average gross salary based on multiple graduate success indicators.

Cleaned and structured dataset (CSV) containing:
- study program name,
- degree type,
- university,
- average gross salary,
- job search duration,
- unemployment percentage,
- relative unemployment & salary indexes.

Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn:
- salary ranking by field of study,
- correlation heatmap between variables.

Machine learning model using scikit-learn:
- linear regression to predict expected salary,
- option to tune and save the best model via cross-validation.
